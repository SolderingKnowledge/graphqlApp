# ignore from now on the content of .env file will be ignored because i will be inserting sensetive informations
# However once I created and added to git and afterwards including in .gitignore file will not make differences to not push it will push anyway
# So, don't include at all from the begining 1) insert in .gitignore then 2) create .env file otherwise it just gets included
# Or run 1) git rm -r --cached . 2) git add . 3) git commit -m <commitMessage> 4) git push
